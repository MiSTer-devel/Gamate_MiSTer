How to render .psg file into the soundtrack, using ay_model.v

1. Have a .PSG file of the AY track. You can use Fuse emulator to make it.

2. Compile all verilog files (system verilog, actually) with filenames defines as stated in render.v
   There's example build and run scripts for modelsim tool.

3. Run testbench until it $stop'ped. On my machines (i7 and k10), it runs 15..18x realtime,
   i.e. 15 to 18 seconds needed to render single second of the resulting soundtrack.

4. By now, you have 3 dump files, each containing single channel.

5. Use downsample.py to convert them into .flac sound file
